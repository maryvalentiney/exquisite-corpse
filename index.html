      <h2>PLACEHOLDER TITLE</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      <p>Deep in the forest, a small pool sits delicately in a clearing. It glows softly with an eerie light and a small figure can be seen kneeling at it's edge. The figure is a mushroom fairy! She has a small hat made from a mushroom cap and gauzy
        delicate wings. She sings to the pool and the water starts to shift and morph, smoothly and with purpose. Eventually, the water crescendos into a rolling and bubbling state, but there is no sign of a creature breaking the surface. It is almost like the water itself is alive.</p>
      <p>As her wings start to flutter rapidly, the fairy leaps into the air excitedly and hovers, clapping as her singing turns into a loud happy chant. Parts of the water rise in the air slowly while still connected to the pond, all still bubbling and simmering.
      The rising water begins to form an outline in the rough shape of a standing giant. A water sprite! As he stands there, water flowing through and dripping from his haphazardly formed body that still sprouts like a tree from the pond, a loud voice booms from
      his head: "HELLO LITTLE ONE"</p>
