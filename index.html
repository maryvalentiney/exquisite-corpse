      <h2>PLACEHOLDER TITLE</h2>
      <p>Deep in the forest, a small pool sits delicately in a clearing. It glows softly with an eerie light and a small figure can be seen kneeling at its edge. The figure is a mushroom fairy! She has a small hat made from a mushroom cap and gauzy
        delicate wings. She sings to the pool and the water starts to shift and morph, smoothly and with purpose. Eventually, the water crescendos into a rolling and bubbling state, but there is no sign of a creature breaking the surface. It is almost like the water itself is alive.</p>
      <p>As her wings start to flutter rapidly, the fairy leaps into the air excitedly and hovers, clapping as her singing turns into a loud happy chant. Parts of the water rise in the air slowly while still connected to the pond, all still bubbling and simmering.
      The rising water begins to form an outline in the rough shape of a standing giant. A water sprite! As he stands there, water flowing through and dripping from his haphazardly formed body that still sprouts like a tree from the pond, a loud voice booms from
      his head: "HELLO LITTLE ONE"</p>
      <p>The fairy flutters around excited and pleased to see her old friend; "Hello Hydros!" she exclaims with joy. Hydros then reaches out his rippling limb and motions the fairy over to see. Just as the fairy tilts her head in to get a good look, a fish suddenly shot out
        from the tip of his limb! "PRESENT FOR YOU!" Hydros shouted excitedly, while the fairy burst out into a glittering laughter fit. "Can you guess where I am going today Hydros?" the fairy asked as she fluttered down onto a cushy mushroom cap. "GOING TO THE TOWN" Hydros responded quickly;
        almost as if he had heard this before. </p>
      <p> "No! Guess again!" the fairy exclaimed mischievously. "GOING TO MARSHES?" Hydros guessed hesitantly. "NO!" shouted the fairy, "I'm going to see the biggest tree in the entire forest!" Hydors was silent, as he was in complete shock. "THAT TREE WAS LOST AGES AGO" Hydros stated slowly
        and assuredly, "IT IS GONE." "But it's not gone! And I'm going to see it." the fairy said in a smug, triumphant tone. "AND YOU KNOW THE WAY?" Hydros asked mockingly. "No...but I know someone who does and they are taking me to it today!" "WHO IS THIS YOU SPEAK OF?"
      </p>
      <p>"Aeros of course! His whistling wind knows no bounds within the forest. He'll guide me to the ancient tree" "AEROS EH? GIVE MY REGARDS TO THE OLD WINDBAG" Hydros chuckled. "I will! Wish me luck. Good to see ya Hydros! And thanks for the friend" the fairy trailed as she took flight away
      from the pond and her old friend Hydros. As she ascended, the fairy carefully put her present from Hydros in her rucksack made of dried forest leaves. The fish poked its head out and gave the fairy a gleeful grin. The pair continued to soar above the tree tops until a great gust of wind and a conjuration
    of clouds appeared. "Hello Aeros" the fairy exclaimed as the clouds were still forming in front of her. The clouds form into a wispy figure and the wind rustles the tops of the trees as he utters "Hello there! Are we ready to see the ancient tree?" "Oh yes, I have been waiting so long to see it" the fairy jolted with glee.
      "Well you won't have to wait much longer because I know the shortcut. Just follow me and try to keep up"</p>
      <p>Aeros whips away just as quickly as he appeared into the lush greenery of the forest. The fairy followed suit with her wings fluttering furiously to keep up as aeros whips through the trees and wraps around and through the branches. The fiary struggles to keep up but eventually finds the emalgamation of clouds
      floating a few inches above a gopher hole. "A gopher hole? Why are we here? This isn't the old tree" wheezed the fairy as she tried to catch her breath. "Oh I am well aware this isn't the tree, but not many people know that the tree was never lost. It was just... displaced. I assure you though, this is no trick. Just a little further".
    The clouds squeezed into the hole and the fairy followed quickly. As the white mist flowed through the tunnels and through the twists and turns they eventually found themselves in a vast open cave. The cave's walls were lined with twisted roots stemming from the central tree. The cave was lit up by fireflies that danced through the air.
      "This is wonderful" the fairy howled. "See like I told you, not lost just displaced. The old tree is very foundation of the whole forest. All of its roots lead up to the surface to create the forest we see today."</p>
      <p>The fairy whirled around in shock, looking up at the twisted canopy of roots above. "This whole forest... it's one tree?"
      "Yes, little one!" the clouds chuffed happily, "the great harmony in this forest is dependent on the life force of this great tree, it's even said that if one places their ear to the trunk, they will be able to hear all of the sounds in the forest."
    This intrigued the fairy, and she flitted over to the massive trunk of the central tree and placed her small, pointed ear to it's bark. All of a sudden her mind was flooded with sounds, she could hear the babbling brook in the northern forest, and Hydros's joyful laughter as he cruised through it. She could hear the conversations of the birds in their trees, the musings of the frogs in the swampy eastern forest. She could even hear the mushrooms, their lilting, strange music singing through the soil and roots of the trees.
  The fairy pulled away from the tree and turned to Aeros, her eyes shining with emotion, "Oh, thank you so much for showing me this, though I am small I feel like I've just grown to the size of a giant, hearing all the voices of my home."</p>
