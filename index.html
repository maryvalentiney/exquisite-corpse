      <h2>PLACEHOLDER TITLE</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      <p>Deep in the forest, a small pool sits delicately in a clearing. It glows softly with an eerie light and a small figure can be seen kneeling at it's edge. The figure is a mushroom fairy! She has a small hat made from a mushroom cap and gauzy
        delicate wings. She sings to the pool and the water starts to shift and morph, smoothly and with purpose. Eventually, the water crescendos into a rolling and bubbling state, but there is no sign of a creature breaking the surface. It is almost like the water itself is alive.</p>
      <p>As her wings start to flutter rapidly, the fairy leaps into the air excitedly and hovers, clapping as her singing turns into a loud happy chant. Parts of the water rise in the air slowly while still connected to the pond, all still bubbling and simmering.
      The rising water begins to form an outline in the rough shape of a standing giant. A water sprite! As he stands there, water flowing through and dripping from his haphazardly formed body that still sprouts like a tree from the pond, a loud voice booms from
      his head: "HELLO LITTLE ONE"</p>
      <p>The fairy flutters around excited and pleased to see her old friend; "Hello Hydros!" she exclaims with joy. Hydros then reaches out his rippling limb and motions the fairy over to see. Just as the fairy tilts her head in to get a good look, a fish suddenly shot out
        from the tip of his limb! "PRESENT FOR YOU!" Hydros shouted excitedly, while the fairy burst out into a glittering laughter fit. "Can you guess where I am going today Hydros?" the fairy asked as she fluttered down onto a cushy mushroom cap. "GOING TO THE TOWN" Hydros responded quickly;
        almost as if he had heard this before. </p>
      <p> "No! Guess again!" the fairy exclaimed mischeviously. "GOING TO MARSHES?" Hydros guessed hesitantly. "NO!" shouted the fairy, "I'm going to see the biggest tree in the entire forest!" Hydors was silent, as he was in complete shock. "THAT TREE WAS LOST AGES AGO" Hydros stated slowly
        and assuredly, "IT IS GONE." "But it's not gone! And I'm going to see it." the fairy said in a smug, triumphant tone. "AND YOU KNOW THE WAY?" Hydros asked mockingly. "No...but I know someone who does and they are taking me to it today!" "WHO IS THIS YOU SPEAK OF?"
